actually fan original flick name starring mills twice pair twins separated birth parents never come contact parents never meet everyone know feel remakes especially films happen enjoy unless youre going either capture exact spirit original something different maybe even brain come gasp new idea remake originally top viewing list actually quite opposite contemporary films one anyway theyre usually unfunny big fat bore least anyone age iq one however shockingly bad fact actually good original good whats great doesnt necessarily retread original capture exact spirit become entertaining exact reasons original entertaining cute innocent fun pretty killer plot endlessly fun follow along lead star immensely appealing parents also immensely appealing im repeating cute innocent fun theres nothing save plot idea separating twins denying truth years selfish precisely point movie aimed directly either kids adults want remember original young adults want remember like kid personally somewhere second third vividly remember taste movies wasnt weird diverse names godard kubrick werent even glimmer right eye back would tune every sunday night couple years see wonderful world disney theyd show liveaction andor madefortv disney flick hour per week remember mom taking sister along friends mothers see rereleased disney films like lady tramp sadly remember every single christmas without fail childrens animated halfhour shows made exclusively christmas season wouldnt dare missing even remember seeing madefortv parent trap ii tv one night seen one saw original parent trap late childhood movie deals issue divorce deals version playful witty charming saw first time right never experienced part childhood id probably dismiss id probably new version movie hadnt seen original perfect age watching could remember fun watch disney film divorce started get thinking possibilities parents splitting affected also fear smooth stroke pointed even situations things could always work well manipulate things bit least better new version also charming way new cast contemporary feel first time awhile flick tone isnt corny condescending right moments would otherwise seem corny actually affecting safe kind way first time since original film kids actually know better foolish adults story basically classic repeated almost many times kurosawas seven samurai pair twins played lindsay like played mills original separated birth parents one annie sent live mother natasha richardson resembling mother vanessa redgrave ever noticed london lives parents devoted foppish butler simon works fashion designer grows refined classy also keen knowledge sports hallie sent northern california father dennis quaid live lisa ann walter grows rugged yet charming meet camp one annie wants go become rugged look similar thus tight competition results nasty winds together private cabin become friends learn eachother know everything scheme switch places one meet parent theyve heard learn lives detail make sure look alike requires hair cutting notoriously scene like kiddie version needle scene pulp fiction end summer comes switch hope best lindsay doesnt necessarily copy acting style mills original comes appealing though add couple new things makes california twin little appealing london twin bit frank snobbish proper original respectively also adds american british accent one one faking accent throughout really take notice see fake ones accents arent exactly perfect shes also incredibly appealing merely cute especially notable since first feature film know notorious child actors especially first films makes great protagonist helps supporting cast equally appealing dennis quaid fact hasnt likable decade big dumb smile near cocky attitude made notable actor past hes mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except hasnt ever likable period two make winning couple maybe winning maureen ohara late brian keith original still work film instead bickering original film adds another dimension another angle characters original opening credits see glimpses courtship fall quickly madly love eachother back together films smarmy scenes come actually sentimental great way way many films brings new parent trap level entertainment hasnt really existed since well original film years ago still money best flick time form intelligence wit makes plot points otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot sharon stone type played elaine hendrix whos deliciously tormented twins later film treat instead bore like original film transcends crap well could case point takes two starring twins treats children smart ones adults silly ones way around everything knows exactly charming without biting chew however comparison original could bit better certain scenes work well nearly well worked original liked way parents fought past fought falling love better liked watching two old flames getting back together bottle wine somehow always cinematic pleasing mere lesson howard grant films much film transcends mere compared original film almost drowns original though gritty far stylized suitable adult audiences young audiences remake may never nearly great classic original film least knows treat source material dignity respect create virtually effects without bordering petty

good long since good old fashioned thriller mostly everything goes right audience wrong characters even longer since saw thriller actually shock cared characters merely judged actually allowed human foibles flaws strengths emerge id saw least couple decades even far back great hitchcock thrillers though im hardly comparing simple plan say rear window strangers train yet almost good simple yet strangely complex astonishingly rewarding instead moving plot point plot point merely laying overtones instead concerns moral corruption depths greed protagonists go without ever judging either evil even elegantly directed sam raimi yes simple plan concerns discovery crashed plane within bag full millions dollars moderately financially stable working man bill paxton dimwitted brother billy bob thornton drinking buddy brent without anyone around possibility one would come looking three debate debate finally reach decision yes keep authorities possible owners cash come looking generally dont flaunt anything dont want flaunt theyll keep away custody paxton circumstance much diverse could endlessly play cat mouse authorities could try fight rightful owners either villainous could fight amongst simple plan though borrows little little cops subplot involving alleged fbi agent chilling gary cole bit inside austin powers would say thats necessarily bag baby admired film makes far superior unique thriller successfully able cake eat effectively involves traditional thriller cliches like ones mentioned time involves deeply way characters become morally corrupt price pay think happiness black bag steps taken neatly cover things subsequent steps go miserably awry film choses never loose sight covering things extent characters slowly losing souls humanity one early scene paxton thornton make trip back plane return money doesnt look like stolen bad idea thornton screws continuously throughout movie paxton major read homicide instead quick murder raimi shows lengthy painful shot onto paxtons face tries emotions reach conclusion theres similar shot afterwards paxton watching murder hes committing taking horror also wonderfully effective previous shot even better morally complex short probably best piece direction ever done demonstrating sometimes way something yields best results proof watch persona sex scene witness may best scene ever done film hardly stops follows completely rarely loses sight characters humanity thereof yet also moves step step graceful method never feel like film merely plot points story time comes paxton start becoming selfish thus diabolical aid pregnant wife played bridget fonda pal raimi soon horror situation tragic heights theres least two grand shootouts least one may one greatest shootouts cinema history arrive dont come masochistic delight cringeinducing horror one actually sinking chair mantra cant head fact film getting many comparisons coens superior forget fargo many similar moments manic insanity attributed major amount subtlety restraint directors direct hands would overthetop imagine suppose robert rodriguez directing seeing evil dead films id hardly assume raimi would able pull something like although moments film easily dubbed raimi moments notwithstanding instead raimi directs maturity gentle touch easily letting story characters still letting traditional raimi elements come like offbeat comic touches particularly billy bob character jacob brilliant creation often hilarious film every line uttered greeted howling laughter theres authenticity performance strangely enough makes sure totally laughing chuckles gets necessarily ones thornton damn real jacobs multidimensional character stupid see much flaw strength character simplicity endearing many acts commits strong inner strength belief system primarily towards middle bud begins make heavy waves concerning money final third film spends much time many touches upon character thornton also screenwriter scott smith adapting book way great particularly admired back story old high school girlfriend told thornton sincerity cruel story reversed strength saddened character thornton absolutely brilliant performance far best performance hes ever given proof hes best character actor contemporary cinema dont believe go back watch wonderful performance primary colors performance would nominated oscar hadnt year hes easily able slip character make completely utterly believable brings much weight film character actors difficult anyone else role rest cast great paxtons working man ross amiable town sheriff even fonda shows talents nicely complaints film plot almost simplistic times seems much like exercise like cruel test humanity still pays attention humanity involved occasional narration usually annoying narration used extreme caution especially youre trying set things andor express emotions didnt raimi watch first murder scene thing usually go wrong movie ending basically wont reveal way cruel much outsider setup appearance plane wasnt already much anyway film deals much humanity characters involved wrong ending imagine ending otherwise like crime punishment police caught instead breaking im comparing simple plan ending work despite something incessantly nagging unsatisfying qualms happy ignore go day despite mere claims make mistake completely utterly edge seat throughout even sometimes situations kind

one film introduced audiences sparked showed something theyd never seen toy story used stateoftheart computer technology presented world toys would come alive humans present many critics call better film believe say completely original motion picture antz however considerably disneys bugs life isnt due another two months dreamworks seems received better end deal beating disney satisfied audiences thirst computeranimated films dont let fool disney definitely scared past two years broken studios volcano duel opinion dantes peak came way ahead predecessor time quality volcano original premise destroyed ridiculous situations twice many competing films first comet competition armageddon blew away dramatic competitor deep impact even interesting one beloved studio disney goes newcomer dreamworks time tell im sure mr mouse nothing fear may sound like didnt like antz contrary id put toy story due pg rating many parents may put dialogue shouldnt appear disneys version dialogue antz pushes envelope film sexual profanity pop occasionally makes dreamworks animated feature geared adult crowd humor also written especially adults though many kids laughing theater attended type film made families often entertaining kids entertaining parents antz begins hilarious monologue seems woody allens shtick franz short story man wakes discover bug allen troubled ant believing made worker youre middle child family five million comments neglected childhood one night sitting bar friend weaver sylvester stallone discussing pathetic place life walks princess bala sharon stone one recognizes without crown bala asks would like dance engage pulp dance everyone else following leader discovering princess falls love theres problem bala getting married general gene hackman ruthless leader merely wants control better stronger colony order must eliminate queen anne bancroft weakest colony namely worker ants get rid queen needs get rid loyal army ants would willing die colonel christopher come plan send loyal ants battle surely killed queen reluctant first decides best colony meanwhile wants meet bala asks weaver army ant switch places gets sent battle manages survive slaughter battle sequence absolutely stunning though may flashbacks starship troopers contained similar sequence however antz film production around time similarities merely coincidence second half film revolves around kidnapping bala search mythical place called ant boss food wants adventures bala get surprisingly high tension especially one involving glass looming targets like spaceships independence day fact im going assume producers intentionally ants look awe beam fire blasts ground visually exciting rush adrenaline dont fooled little kids shouldnt see may try copy seeing antz vowed never intentionally step ant hopefully children learn killing ants rather cruel animated film antz probably best find date visually stunning dreams may come best aspect animation fact characters arent limited gravity take ridiculous situations make seem plausible one great moment involves mass worker ants form wrecking ball animation perfect virtually see every single ant ball however exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck bottom young boys shoe truly great example film making finest computer technology animators carefully made ants faces look similar actors providing voices best example would danny glover one point even see face although doubt ants also touching rather gruesome scene final words without body young kids may disturbed site head good deal humor derived appropriate adults course disneys bugs life looks good dont know able best dreamworks newest animated feature terms animation dreamworks done something studio could go head head big mouse knock yes anastasia good nearly good even worst disney vocal talent always essential animated feature antz one best seen since toy story fact far exceeds one woody allen always funny transcends hes done past years without body comic timing noticeable thing fact im pretty sure writers let improvise lot lines sharon stone bala shows comic ability though part stone works best dramatic actress sylvester stallone teamed stone beginning statement wants actor typecast action star oscars last year stallone proving serious comedic illustrated actor gene hackman superb general almost another take crimson tide persona christopher probably noticed voice many people remember hits batman returns anne bancroft minimal role shes effective nonetheless danny glover small role good job dan aykroyd jane also lend voices two unrecognizable especially aykroyd jennifer lopez plays worker ant falls love weaver although people wont recognize voice either many people recognize grant voice foreman played miles tv show murphy brown definitely huge cast highprofile names definitely help course probably tell lot million budget went also directors eric darnell lawrence relative newcomers though direct feature headless show incredible talent type picture tense times funny throughout two hold film together like professionals screenplay todd alcott chris weitz quite simple plot contains lot subtlety makes film suitable adults kids delight animation parents laugh humor go young childrens heads mean shouldnt take kids see lot fun watching one great themes given us part social commentary part romance story part moral drama antz gives everyone something talk whether animation discussions community thankfully subtle either aspects antz rated pg mild language intense action sometimes language

much wanted like film went pleased left first getting usual lines newspaper liked scream youll love wild things campbell gives stunning performance twisty plot dazzled days oh yeah day newspaper uses day neve campbell falls love onto serious stuff film mean nearly sarcastic way wild things singlehandedly broken rules surrounding rating mpaa im saying bad way see film may shocked see however perhaps mpaa pleased films charming cast tricky plot let film slide rating im bound hear religious warning see film trouble already seen like wild things film noir filled sensibilities yet breaking rules modernday culture style filmed rich color actors gorgeous people seemingly drawn gene pool placed film sure good true aint fun watch movies like come along sort better version basic instinct bound people either love hate people dont want admit liking see tell anyone sees like wild things begins blue bay high school one high school world teenager would love get almost students put entrance totally based looks alone course select may look slightly ugly compared average person gorgeous immediately film finds tone audience settles enjoyable time turn brains right wrong may expecting one thing happen certainly doesnt turn way film begins nearly main characters present theres sam lombardo matt dillon counselor students hes heading class discussion theres also kelly van ryan denise richards rich teen fallen love sam teaching class however two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon gloria perez daphne rubinvega want talk sex cheers crimes sex crime ray asks one student responds pretty much sets tone film watch however upon hearing one student suzie toller neve campbell stands leaves room commenting kiss part body wild things sets motion quickly kelly begins hitting sam sam doesnt want anything advances kelly stubborn continues pursue even pleads let wash jeep surprisingly thats really tell plot would give away one many crucial plot twists whats plot twists actually unpredictable going along way scream wild things maintains films surprises adds even plot twists film probably ever seen even though think may get tired surprises genuine rather pleasing going back mind nearly work though stretch boundaries belief thankfully convoluted plot doesnt give us much time think one yet another twist us shock previous one worn critics complain film pretty much one trashy film however kind trashy isnt hard watch good trash sense one screenplay knows taken seriously includes lot humor satire story varies everywhere kellys mother theresa russell caricature rich people way lawyer bill murray wears cover insurance scam running bill murray also provides best character film genuine laughs two sex gratuitous although wild things supposed sex film title wouldnt movie breaks boundaries instead heterosexual sex scenes also includes lesbian scenes denise richards neve campbell dont worry graphic might think heterosexual scenes quite graphic surprise shocker kevin bacons nude scene brief blink may miss ahem long remember dont think seen rrated film show one completely judging audiences reaction expected also one scene late film seemed relationship brewing bacon characters nothing came makes wonder director cut order rating actors refused first made want see wild things cast neve campbell course one favorite actresses since scream films released however turns every typical role done head plays gothic closest role performance craft though even nice girl campbell probably best film shows wide range talent tell around long time denise richards also around long time although may limited roles without much range gets express emotions stiff yet effective performance starship troopers hopefully one day land good role display ability daphne rubinvega newcomer movies gives good performance although character mostly left background first hour half towards end get bigger part male side matt dillon probably best giving subtle performance surprises every twist kevin bacon slightly wooden character makes must admiration though screen judging many womens reactions theater shot grown deeper appreciation bacon yeah right bill murray performance comic relief nearly steals film whole entire cast works together seem home even troi director john mcnaughton previously done critically acclaimed henry portrait serial killer constructed wonderfully twisty plot works direction smooth stylish visuals striking filled rich colors almost realistic actually breathe air however seems home actors arent talking shots areas brilliant photography denise richards climbing pool highlight cinematography gorgeous details often see film like watch see camera take pictures music probably obvious thing set perfect mood film hard describe words see film listen wonderfully composed presented sure stick around closing credits mcnaughton finally put ending credits good use comedies use outtakes included small scenes help explain preceding events may say lame attempts explain convoluted plot entertaining way finish film plus shocking moments ending credits add fun wild things appropriately rated strong sexuality nudity language violence nudity rather unnecessary lets face want see give neve campbell admirably clause contract see behind takes top way go neve sex scenes graphic especially first one see mother one deck hands one almost wonders got away rating language quite harsh ranging sexual innuendo average everyday profanity cant stress enough dont allow kids see film target age movie range thats see definitely mention film rated however get chance watch probably likely pleased may even take friends see next time

seen may crossgates cinema theater brother john theater rating excellent seats sound picture critics note review ive ever written still scratches surface id recommend read seen film form critical analysis friend fellow film critic ted said review phantom menace even write review never mind fact ive waiting new star wars movie since seven years old never mind fact everyone internet already discussed movie even released never mind theres much going movie terms plot action special effects longterm story analyze every aspect would take lot time energy still wouldnt cover everything also like ted reviews ill try review way different usual reviews instead write casually possible talking directly reader begin specific aspects film many general significant factors must considered get specifics film skip next four made obvious last several years another trilogy films produced account missing initial three installments star wars series first films actually episode four one george lucas creator series probably assumed people know trilogy star wars empire strikes back return jedi actually second trilogy media interviews past explained movies made order cant recall reasons new film writer director also assumed viewers least vaguely familiar storylines significant plot points first trilogy second trilogy well know mean order review many significant points must mentioned unfortunately may serve spoilers proceed caution critics note one personal policy intentionally analyze spoilers would like reviews able make sense reader viewing film reviewed would nearly impossible film justice without breaking rule critics note reviewing film also breaks universal critics law reviewing movies roger ebert movie many outside factors come play films plot significance part trilogy considering modern society would difficult impossible simply review film completely story first know film even going know young anakin skywalker grow become evil ruler darth vader also father luke skywalker lead successful revolution empire know obiwan ben kenobi trainer anakin ways force attempts become jedi knight would fail thus anakin would fall dark side also know something force kind universal force fate manipulated whose minds expanded enough believe feel jedi dont know sure history ruling galaxy likely much longer complex government earth one fascinating aspects first three films seemed subtle definite order complexity also seems supposed familiar details story come thousands comic books published years since movies ended notably details regarding emperor empire jedi senator last name havent kept star wars years still way know details simply recognizing actor voice least phantom menace first chapter long saga one would assume basic would laid including history behind major factors series especially force jedi knights unfortunately film opposite simply builds top must history long detailed could never explained didnt liked aspect film one reasons falls short greatness youre going tell story beginning tell beginning possible trilogy complete could another trilogy episodes back story even digress ive said much yet havent even touched specifics film necessary elements go show vast story star wars series individual film get movie unlike three weve come know love since late films helps keep spirit series familiar time seems flaw filmmaking process since sometimes rings basic story rather complex even confusing times told army known trade federation set blockade around seemingly insignificant planet called naboo given many details back story federation purpose instead film opts get story moving quickly introduced two jedi master quigon jinn neeson apprentice obiwan kenobi mcgregor two acting sort hopes ending obvious federation planets queen amidala portman leader federation alien called following orders strange mythical character older human man whose face body covered black robe hood wears referred lord considering appearance especially creepy evil voice obviously one significant characters series digital never person clearly actual something wants keep secret would also reveal identity never openly revealed film clear viewers feeling well delve background next two films doesnt take film long spring action within minutes hero jedi fighting lives films story begins move along film doesnt one specific plot works manner films series get one adventure top another many film would describe gives movie hook films relied type storytelling limits technology time films screenplays also sense gives phantom menace unique traits already know film takes place least generation two original star wars trilogy means lot background unclear andor unexplained may cleared beginning vast epic story significant storyline involving discovery anakin skywalker lloyd quigon jinn introduction jedi council briefly story jinn stumbles upon skywalker attempt buy parts queen spaceship damaged efforts free federation meeting tatooine mostly chance course jinn force jinn feel skywalker great natural power force another subplot involving bet skywalker fantastic race enter details significance begin reveal also provides new explanation force never mentioned fact seems something important upsetting never mentioned element seriously undermines mystical aspect force transforms something physical scientific completely unnecessary films third act major significant elements become tied together rather familiar execution plot funny reality star wars world seems embedded mythology new philosophy religion yet solution major conflicts series violence technique hasnt used movies reallife situations countless times throughout history least spirit ultimate powers good versus evil fun exciting matter border cartoonish sometimes thats film appealing inner child basic reason entire saga exists become big part modern society phantom menace delivers exactly youd expect star wars film succeeds well always never truly achieves greatness many things film weve seen done heart filmmakers concentrated bit story character limited film far bad least spirit sheer fun movies

alien alien film seen theaters saw years old must admit didnt like course expecting aliens believe fault order appreciate alien need see aliens also wipe away expectations predecessor james camerons aliens action film many people consider best series among group alien extremely entertaining film critics originality many thought final chase scene went long many others thought film much dialogue enough action film quite bit action dialogue essential wellwritten chase sequence long overly long creating quite bit suspense confusion perhaps watching alien video helped big screen overwhelmed something normally didnt see dark film language extremely harsh always figured alien series rely smart dialogue instead moronic dont get saying films eliminate swearing film dialogue profane remarks gets rather distracting however since seeing realize swearing mainly aspect restrained hatred characters result alien flaw albeit major one underdeveloped characters never really care get feeling many scenes cut order length movie two characters liked course one lt ripley sigourney weaver although gotten know two films character dr charles dance like inevitable occurs alien begins exactly aliens left prologue alien pure cinematic achievement director david fincher directed music videos chance alien entry without using single line dialogue unless count computer warnings fincher sets entire film impressive aspect fincher shows seconds film cutting title card see lt ripley little girl cryogenic title shot alien egg title alien legs stretch air title first ten minutes learned everything order alien proceed quite remarkable opening one remain mind long time facehugger aboard vessel aliens sent escape pod sent nearest planet turned maximum security prison however facehugger managed attach one sent escape pod unfortunately landing one survivors aliens killed ripley discovered inmates taken back course need carrier facehugger dog came team inmates ripley revived asks see ship seeing mysterious section ripley asks see dead bodies scene one powerful impressive alien films featuring monologue dillon charles dutton prisoner found god movie cuts back forth ceremony dogs demise one memorable moments speech reflects exactly going dog alien succeeds fincher normally lot symbolism films easily see becoming next stanley kubrick alfred hitchcock fact mixture fincher knows exactly film film figure one directors complete control films alien riddled symbolic speeches metaphorical images fincher creates best scenes entire alien franchise many people criticized finchers filming death scene ripley reveal nothing saying looking fake enjoy relish portrayal showing ripley fall slow motion nice touch actually showing hit iron great deal symbolism derived feel would spoiled mood entire film actually shown splash iron however people seem want witness ripley die creates paradox character didnt want see die killed one surprises film dont plan spoiling review every alien film comes several memorable moments seem stick forever alien course moment alien burst stomach aliens showdown alien ripley machine alien several memorable terrific shot involving alien ripley ripley pushed wall alien stands away doesnt kill shocker later leads surprise ending fincher apparently loves use closeups actors faces michael douglas clown faceoff game style actors hair thing look faces many critics didnt like actors bald makes complete sense taken context plot alien works take context story try compare predecessors finchers turn seems bit gloomy dark though thats always bad thing plot pretty much rehash first two films major twists setup several different characters one one picked however first two tons arsenal especially camerons film alien takes place planet devoid human life except rundown prison result weapons found creates lot tension although must admit fincher could added lot suspense alien film alien worst series extremely wellmade motion picture lot merits unfortunate thing surrounding second sequel onedimensional characters never really emotionally involved screen characters hardcore criminals really could care less despite ripley central figure thats important care even though began act like one guys technical side film remarkable better two previous versions camerons version pumped action film massive fincher uses brilliant camera angles terrific lighting moody sets cinematography alex well done terrific chase sequence towards end movie confusion ending draws viewer confused actors chased around reds lights create dark mood create lot suspense shadows dance walls yet shadows could easily alien alien different predecessors time around alien quite intense camera likes take perspective alien racing characters sets quite incredible alien narrow corridors well constructed sets appear future far future one set pieces even aids destruction alien nothing surprising sigourney weaver turns yet another good performance portrayal ripley aliens snubbed oscars one mainly film critical bomb reactions far realistic film crying loss little child life saving previous encounter quite touching really charles dutton strong performance one inmates brink actually caring charles dance turns nice lowkey performance result cared immediately lance henriksen makes brief appearance bishop ii entertaining aliens rest cast pretty stale though pete sticks due recent turns usual suspects lost world alien rated strong violence language sex although flaws alien highly entertaining rich symbolism film reminds much fun spot metaphorical images

personal story feels like needs either another chapter another angle final one need feel like character really made big change life story story like one town could inspire change personal life feels like half maybe even less travolta great job though never truly memorable performance rather zallian whose final chapter needs rewrite though engrossing drama one best year fact one best lawyer films period reason recognizes court trial rather lawyers knights battle eachother learn company almost positively blame deaths town reason cant blamed best find duvalls facher brilliant character magnificent job portraying man almost easy overlook great facher seen elderly man goofy eccentric carrying broken brown bag eating paper bags making point take time day listen radio anyone look deeper

really wasnt great still give positive review starship troopers hand mocking sense humor knowing perfectly well ridiculous may seem result starship troopers exciting energetic lively science fiction film fact probably could never get tired watching film starship troopers star wars another kickass space opera scifi drama altogether starship troopers star wars comes quite close easiest assessment would call film star wars generous film perhaps science fiction film comes along mix humor romance effectively warring races essence science fiction pulp fiction easiest way write review film would compare science fiction films may starship troopers quite original film director paul verhoeven gives film style style except forced likely cause smith major role new star wars simple basic plot mankind vs alien species alien species question bugs seemingly advanced civilization insects however underlying morals starship troopers fleshed deadly accuracy sometimes morals buried bloody violence

film surprisingly average extremely refreshing watch scifi war film actually root human side something independence day never achieved starship troopers begins satirical portrayal strange join army ads mixing events refreshingly original stating would like know short news give film immediate sense humor know take seriously however also witness murder several troopers battle gory yet funny way witnessing slaughter film jumps back one year setup saw introduced johnny rico casper van dien carmen denise richards rico flirts carmen sending messages computer school however carmen isnt interested rico becoming pilot however another classmate dizzy flores dina meyer eye rico unfortunately rico isnt interested dizzy setup rather cliched result setup still fun watch carmen signs become starship

event horizon rating well deserved hopefully parents allow year old children see guess verhoevens target audience male group film testosterone level charts chiseled men beautiful women despite superficial elements starship troopers also creates world made star wars successful watching film never second guess characters decisions seem perfectly clear thankfully hero punching aliens face

may seem weird begin film glam rock sequence includes spaceship green pin birth oscar wilde one really strains see perhaps maybe connections half philosophy everyone true human nature result following philosophy imprisoned family career glam rock movement early england similar take came similar demise main difference placing makeup face acting deepest fantasies life mostly dealing sexuality became less less like like everyone else thats movement seemed end soon began said todd haynes velvet film chronicles like part movement experienced created steals lot citizen kane thats true film british journalist arthur stuart christian bale asked go back find happened glam rock star brian slade fictitious rock star faked death stage bringing end career entire glam rock movement totally steals kane setup interviews three people story result flashbacks things like beginning death smaller details like bitter wheelchair bitter exwife washedup lounge singer found bar hours kane really doesnt aspire doesnt attempt deep outlook something gone like kane doesnt really uncover anything poignant humanity instead uses flashbacks form contrast magic glam rock era boredom life glam rock participants scenes dry melancholy equipped performance bale perhaps appropriately dull unengaging scenes engaging though mention campy gorgeous cinematography nicely vibrant colors era feel thats eerily lighthearted combined become symbol times everything seemed simple instead creating world way haynes paints world fairy tale glam rock movement full much freedom liberation youve experienced everything else seems mundane theres outside world speak people inside protective globe eventually crack haynes focuses story tale blade fictitious rock hero wild relationship created molded brought movement everyone else contributed merely blade played pouty jonathan rhys meyers wild played anarchic ewan mcgregor little thinly disguised david bowie iggy pop respectively complete creation stardust persona named maxwell demon confirmation two rock stars may well onetime partners music also partners bed discussions cecil michael feast exwife mandy toni collette american blonde dish fakes british accent slade finally wild journalist stuart begins remember experiences era like discovery conformity including moment began questioning sexuality opens first slade record finds naked green slade lying crimson blanket finally running away home part london scene finally resulting leading boring job america haynes demonstrates hes quite visual auteur scenes like long heald seemingly long sequence concert performing brian cover babys fire scenes decadent drug party films sequence first concert scene wild band mcgregor lets loose much anarchic steam wild movements including stripping naked screams film captures perfect moment one discovers major talent another slade discovers idle even brief music videos spoofs rare visual flair thats pure camp would cause ken russell best sequence though may beginning following prelude sequence acts middle ground actual movement era stuart going infamous slade concert fakes death kills alter ego maxwell demon appears real brought end era one swift fake bullet brian famous needle eye playing background scene detached song doesnt seem played quite way songs distance thats hard put finger seems represent coming quick sad ending one sees slade dressing room show silver wings blue hair staring mirror comes prophecy finale beginning film movies much plot way presented making one films classified style substance statement many critics line attack however part engaging part film story rather way haynes creates world using sets costumes cinematography especially music play characters film music especially notable soundtrack wall wall consists old school glam rock tunes likes brian music well covers band vocals occasionally rhys meyers even newer music shudder think sounds cast rather impressive one really walks away film performances extremely good although eddie manager challenges first manager match see gets control career michael feast first tragic manager come greatly collette mcgregor moments rhys meyers bale subpar neither putting lot effort respective roles fault actual construction film haynes rhys meyers brian slade remains merely metaphor glam rock era dying turned resorting life found lying around coke ass party girl fact one film really seen person rather symbol type era character especially tough sell bitter depressed flashbacks young adulthood hes extremely personal character cliched experiences record store guys buying record put never help us communicate nevertheless rhys meyers mcgregor characters really characters rather results era left others bitter part helps film work since major piece eye candy prime movie least look role leaders slade persona wild topless unpredictable image clash unstable union story slade influenced wild adapted similar attitude crossed camp engaging without personal background story stuart though tougher sell hes everyman cant totally identify everyman storys slight trouble cultural rock piece velvet rather good merely good never totally takes although moments absolutely flies comes back really nothing bunch really great moments surrounded material could really much better beginning captivating slow middle fantastic ending shallow worse drags final half hour bring story real conclusion could probably stop point anyone really figure mystery arthur almost seems like point entire investigation past commendable totally still oliver

scary stayed away addition critics rejected heart compared disney animated features whatever real reason black cauldron financial disaster grossing million failure film grounded studios animation department exiled animation team buildings nearby seemed like animated features would longer become part studios reputation next two disney animated features great mouse detective oliver company although little lighthearted black cauldron didnt much better although oliver company grossed much black cauldron great mouse detective little mermaid studio regain reputation successful animated features black cauldron rereleased cities temporary time title taran magic cauldron finally studio locked film film vault denied ever even released might ask black cauldron really bad movie people seen film didnt think fact many people calls home video film course denied seemed like black cauldron would never released video september disney released black cauldron video united kingdom people imported video england converted including hadnt seen film yet included got quite treat people copies black cauldron noticed scene horned king raises army deathless warriors seconds looking skeletons slightly trimmed film would get rating uk rating means universal suitable ages kinda like version somewhere online team diehard black cauldron fans signed said bring back black cauldron disney finally decided release video united states time rumors online made video would trimmed like uk video would get rating would add songs rumors put rest walt disney company announced black cauldron would released pg rated version even still finally released us reaction mixed felt indeed cut felt wasnt minor criticisms seemed laughable since film absent thirteen years finally available saw movie first time converted video didnt expect much fact heard many mediocre things didnt think film would ever good film much surprise saw first minutes film asking film everyone saw one flopped box office one critics filmgoers alike called bad movie doesnt seem like instead classic right film wonderful cast characters theres taran grant assistant pig would rather warrior storys hero critics said taran likeable opposite true brave loyal eventually learns lesson friendship later theres likeable character hes likeable character film theres gurgi john lovable little uh thing remains loyal taran even though dont quite hit first another likeable character bad guy comic henchman named phil loyal films imaginative sinister villain horned king voiced gruesomely john hurt yet also fears neck characters including sidekicks spunky sweet princess named eilonwy comic bard fflewdurr three comically wicked witches hide dark secret although pleasant likeable arent quite well rounded story adventurous one quest involving mystical pig hen wen black cauldron army deathless ones everything opening spectacular finale music also tells story perfectly dark yet manner animation surprisingly good considering film created darkest time studios even though occasional effects quite good like ground opening black cauldron rises earth animation overall top notch overall film entertaining endeavor fans unfamiliar lloyd alexander chronicles get kick one except young kids extremely scary scenes darker disneys films although consider stampede sequence lion king observing fires hell hunchback notre dame scary main reason film rated pg fans familiar lloyd alexander series recognize differences novel movie even though doesnt ingredients true disney film film classic right deserves far better chance given better chance finally come whatever reason black cauldron big failure seems disappeared film finally achieved place among disneys achievements cant help think though whatever would happened black cauldron box office success

john cusack kind actor seems effortlessly slide respective film roles effortlessly people tend forget hes much way people rarely recall many great character actors anyone put name james actors face invited treat product one example day mother asked expert course movies worth seeing never mind tastes couldnt ill never forget day recommended go see night roxbury god fair pissed telling go lot fun didnt see anything futile attempt conversation little might enjoy high fidelity usual whose one question whose answer seems immediately conjure kind movie went see reply julia roberts probably assume something light sylvester stallone movie picture bloodbath words much woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people usually jewish faith upper east side palace anyway answered john cusack rather stunned unreasonable know referring know fact mother seen several cusack movies recently john malkovich pushing tin suppose understandable would recognize name names tougher faces showed picture cusacks mug paper hoping oh yes hes quite good instead got dont know point way beyond frustration realm nose hair anger yes ignorance takes get nose hair pulling zone till realized something doubt much america would recognize cusacks relatively bland even name rather bland compared coolness brad pitt tom cruise names tongue speeding car cusack cusack quite cool im sure twenty years cusack forever referred guy add cusack film choice hes brand name movies usually arent big unassuming way hes kind genius pleasant common man looks charming become one likeable romantic leading men sure thing say anything cusack talents early tom hanks early jack lemmon despite fact nearly every character plays variation character every man hes constantly enjoyable screen persona like albert brooks woody allen knows chose scripts stephan baldwins val kilmers seem put everything former actually insight follow oscar winner usual suspects pauly shore vehicle judging latest projects looks like still yet fire agent cusack generally picks rewarding projects save unwatchable hot pursuit film also featuring young ben stiller high fidelity second collaboration hit miss english director stephan fears country hit also cowritten cusack collaborators terrific comedy grosse point blank quite entertaining funny film progresses meandering fashion movie cast something spell high fidelity begins ode rob record store owner opens film breaking fourth wall much abandon us top break ups list something cusack entire film la ferris day first vaguely annoyed mostly reminded much film body shots used similar conceit began grow due almost entirely cusacks witty delivery hes kind guy dont mind talking directly us gradually film settles character study guy must confront personal failures order figure true person yes existential though plotline mostly enjoyable thing liked film much pleasure offers introducing us minor characters really something terrific enough warrant films best jack black funny show program sadly went way bruce willis hair unfortunately annoying smirk remains record store employee bullies customers buying exactly wants buy hes kind guy im sure weve met thinks hes always right anything power yell argue insult opinion onto others like guy black plays actor round baby face crazy eyes despite size leaps like manic speed freak might bit redundant description seeing speed freaks know manic hes kind supporting character would impossibly annoying comic relief films look hack jan de bont poor phillip seymour hoffman twister fears black never let happen character steeped reality hes top way probably relate catherine zetajones brief role gives vivid portrayal women completely enamored charm tim robbins registers even part new character played entirely cartoon yuks still manages work desired comic effect one exception acting department bit main love interest played danish actress completely trace danish accent replacing stilted american give kudos attempting contradictory role instead likeable comes across rather robotic hard see cusacks character would obsessed especially beautiful intelligent writer natasha wagner potentially waiting wings reminded say anything charming cusack paired charmless ione skye midnight garden good evil poor bastard put alison eastwood whose unbelievably wooden father clint special people whose wheels turn little slower fact cusack rarely paired personality matches though id bet laura natasha switched roles result would effective high fidelity works almost entirely strength characters performances fears direction somewhat stilted script sometimes little word im beginning hate use alas must quirky good think ill blame scott rosenberg judging beautiful girls con air things denver dead fingerprints irritating bits movie cusack really deserve award damn im afraid talents understated may wait till hip needs replacing offered award worthy considerable talent character rob whose sort like older bitter lloyd say anything funny tragic without pathetic cusack still onto minds audiences something achievement

countries legal systems take rule law principle seriously forbidden judges make matters could involve personally luckily movie reviewers arent burdened otherwise small pool special movies would forever ignored reviewer case star wars science fiction epic george lucas consequences would even severe film special millions hundreds millions fans case objectivity something seldom seen star wars reviews majority reviewers rate one best best film times dont usually difficulties hiding artistic author review must also concede inability use cold objective standards reviewing film like many previous reviewers must note watched star wars first time twenty years ago remained enchanted experience ever since perhaps childlike fascination wonders happened long time ago galaxy far away perhaps rush felt minutes opening shots expectations already pumped comic books read anyway watching star wars one important movie going experiences life also unmatched many years come movies managed strong impact like george lucas epic star wars wasnt important movie millions fans probably share sentiment defining moment history modern cinema american motion picture industry limbo social turmoil

casualties trend science fiction movie genre science fiction movies mostly domain late bigger budgets science fiction didnt look strange anymore thanks great success space odyssey success hollywood science fiction bleak rest production mostly dark movies however star wars showed genre inspiration popular movies even among audience usually doesnt like result seriousness cinematic science fiction began fading away although good dark cult quality sf continued filmed early science fiction continued considered family entertainment ironically man responsible star wars time considered member new hollywood generation young movie authors made artsy personal films early george lucas established sf movie thx nostalgic drama american movies considered personal time despite latter one becoming popular sense star wars also personal film way final production shows commercial unlike many personal movies era personality line wishes general audience plot set long time ago galaxy far away begins

role date james earl jones whose voice enough cause peter incarnation pure evil human form unfortunately cant said main leads among main trio mark hamill carrie fisher harrison ford last one character threedimensional enough launch acting career thing looked like important segment star wars phenomena initial release new level special effects technology often comparisons space odyssey another groundbreaking sf film sheer number effects proof lucas kubrick however special effects john john indeed impressive even two decades although special edition improve significantly yet arent remembered trademark movie honour definitely go oscar winning soundtrack john williams whose work star wars probably brightest gem brilliant career newer generations viewers might somewhat deprived still holds

people enjoy science fiction often faced unpleasant surprises due novels stories comic books movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously science fiction pure fantasy supernatural horror rather simple cases mistakes understandable genre boundaries never clearly marked believe really cases movie science fiction actually happens straight historical epic thing occurred former fifteen years ago national distributors gave treatment right stuff film directed philip kaufman mistake distributors could explained fact official poster film features men space suits right stuff film isnt even fiction based book tom covering early years american space program plot film begins people heard edwards air force base major test site experimental planes major aim test flights determine ability aircraft reach speed thus break sound barrier many pilots tried achieve goal many paid lives bravado one quiet pilot chuck eager played sam shaped succeeds thus gives example whole new generation test pilots determined enter history books breaking new speed records ten years later soviets launched sputnik beginning space age order regain national us government decides first send man space best air force navy marine pilots recruited program yeager lacks college education desired image one critics right stuff named one among top films made high position could explained fact film looks quite atypical time three hours length epic scope looked suitable age hollywood used make films larger life real reason lies fact made truly remarkable talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation using opportunities golden age order create original memorable movies right stuff last swan song era producers allowed directors spend big bucks unusual artsy projects right stuff unusual lacks many standard elements hollywood film plot almost nonexistent coherent story featuring many interesting incidents anecdotes shifts focus old generation test pilots embodied yeager new generation astronauts film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager also appears small cameo remains true hero film equal time exposure also given astronauts wives making movie ensemble piece gave opportunity kaufman use multitude great acting talents bit character roles sam shepard great yeager war hero whose greatest achievement sound barrier remained obscured history books probably due surface lacks personality compared hyped fortunate astronaut colleagues shepard gives texture character subtle gestures phrases performance followed great acting ed harris marine future politician john glenn young dennis quaid fine arrogant fighter jock cooper arrogance mirrored friend tragic figure virgil superbly played fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides comic relief navy arguably first american man space alan shepard kaufman left room female talents barbara pamela reed veronica mary jo great pilots wives royal also impressive menacing figure preacher memorable performances belong donald johnson jane nurse great acting talent assembled film mirrored superb direction notable methods kaufman uses order suggest passage time beginning film shows test pilots living middle desert virtual unknowns far away strict rules discipline everything seems natural yeager indulge horse riding yards away fastest precious aircraft world setting quite normal important technical problems solved simple chainsaw test pilots report broken important flights times changing alliance replaced cold war natural pilots like yeager must replaced conventional pilots entire lives become focus media frenzy job subjected strict rules meticulous plans must fight politicians uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert von played scott beach preserve basic human dignity contrast beautifully edited sequence yeager final spectacular test flight absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame fortune although even going space contrasts similar effects achieved superb use poetic movie language editing great photography caleb provides many memorable scenes like funeral desert astronauts suits walking slow motion image would copied many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support nasa american military provided authentic locations period equipment still use special effects order space flights effects excellent still fool audience accustomed cgi real footage earth outer space another fine contribution film oscar awarded musical score bill still excitement every time hear accompanied use songs used background also provide authentic atmosphere historical period film great cult status well deserved minor flaws mercury astronauts arent fleshed enough although played fine actors like lance henriksen film also lacks proper closure hand logical conclusion film landing moon would require film six hours long also critics prone attack film hard russians portrayed evil monsters line cold war rhetoric america contemporary interviews kaufman approach claiming wanted make film authentic possible order portrayed russians real life perceived americans early time passed dont see astronauts heroes age widespread satellite communications routine space missions men women space suits seen mere workers young boys want astronauts grow film sentimental reminder times future began perhaps could encourage least follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new sky even decide stay earth could still appreciate right stuff extraordinary piece cinema

star wars episode phantom menace review matt movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm affection like george lucas classic star wars original blockbuster film two sequels wonder passion generation filmgoers deeply american pop culture arguably americans today explain force jedi budget years release original years since third film return jedi new star wars film weight expectations anticipation new storyline new cast characters possibly compete legends first trilogy luke han solo darth vader cultural icons challenge fourth star wars film episode one phantom menace hit screens last week despite early critical reviews major media film neither flop disappointment phantom menace certainly finest film series nonetheless engaging exciting visually breathtaking worthy sequel er prequel original star wars films phantom menace takes place decades setting original films film opens obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor wise old master introduced luke force original star wars young jedi apprentice still learning fellow jedi instructor quigon jinn liam neeson republic government sent two jedi settle trade dispute developed blockade planet naboo shifty trade federation jedi quickly find negotiations middle invasion rushing protect young queen amidala natalie portman later eventually rescuing amidala helping escape naboo forced stop tatooine repair ship bringing galactic senate make appeal justice tatooine quigon discovers young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd help get parts need displays uncanny intelligence insight instincts quigon senses child unusually strong force begins suspect may one bring balance force anyone watched original star wars trilogy knows far galactic savior time become ruthless darth vader complicating matters mysterious hooded figure darth behind trade blockade invasion naboo sends lethal apprentice darth maul find capture queen amidala amidala jedi fight save planet soon also deal deadly relentless darth maul plot sounds bit complicated phantom menace introduces earlier generation characters immediate crisis sets foundation events eventually lead fall republic demise jedi knights turn evil rise dark empire original trilogy complexity overwhelming story moves quickly drawback many questions predictably remain unanswered end film setting stage next episode one reasons films story seems hazy confusing unfocused unclear whose story phantom menace original trilogy movies clearly lukes story stories around growth rebel hero jedi knight unclear whether new film story trilogy centered anakin shaky foundation lloyd like many child actors lacks subtle acting skills adult performers result character seems shallow unimpressive screen see nothing suggests dark side lurking underneath face matter presence would make seem special quigon willing believe one rest cast fine though often work iffy dialogue lucas neeson perfect aging jedi knight mcgregor obiwan conveys balance youthful energy calm sensibility portman fits role young queen well lines often formal giving little room give character much personality biggest problem phantom menace plot characters interaction characters new film less developed original star wars storyline confusing previous films series unlike previous trilogy lucas doesnt good job playing characters one another star wars immediate contrasts memorable exchanges luke han han obiwan leia luke ensemble played immediately showed distinct attitudes personalities sequence luke han chewbacca attempt rescue leia cell death star audience learns lot four characters ways react immediate problems comparable sequence phantom menace flesh characters relationships interesting characters clear motivations interests lucas develops little chemistry tension perhaps glaring weakness film probably reason disappointed many reviewers despite need richer dialogue stronger character interaction film still engaging many wonderful elements lucas previous films make phantom menace memorable entertaining first course remarkably rich imaginative universe lucas creates characters visit magical underwater cities evade sea monsters fight battle droids menacing planet naboo watch spectacular event part race part circuit desert planet tatooine head gothic urban capital republic home galactic senate jedi council location elaborate complex lucas never settles vague ideas look settings creates rich spectacular landscapes new special effects rereleased special edition trilogy changes allowed give earlier movies look feel werent possible films made ever new film lucas universe filled creatures robots personalities supporting cast aliens interact main characters best character greedy tatooine junk dealer owns anakin mother slaves italian voice short body oddly mismatched wings like floats

accept hes never lose sight fact animated character initially found jar jar annoying grew enjoy humor added film second viewing film jar jar lot fun didnt mind second reason film continues fine tradition star wars movies film replete humor small details flesh world lucas creates despite films struggles good evil sober ones destiny force like star wars films phantom menace never takes seriously fortunately lucas hasnt lost sight fact films entertainment high art bumbling jar jar announcer team calling action films thrilling sequence cameo appearance film phantom menace simply lot fun lots jokes humor easily missed finally phantom menace works films speed action beginning end lightsaber battles chases thrilling good evil sequence tatooine one entertaining exciting scenes star

even best star wars film id put third original empire strikes back exciting entertaining film far better typical summer blockbuster film cant live hype film even original star wars could done still
