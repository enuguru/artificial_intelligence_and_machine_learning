### Context
Data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts, also known as market basket analysis . It has been demonstrated this by using unsupervised ML technique (K-Means Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.
### Content
We are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards, we have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. Spending Score is something we assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.
### Problem Statement

The generated "Clusters of Customers" plot shows the distribution of the 5 clusters. A sensible interpretation for the mall customer segments can be:
<li>Cluster 1(orange) - Customers with medium annual income and medium annual spend</li>
<li>Cluster 2(yellow) - Customers with high annual income and high annual spend</li>
<li>Cluster 3(purple) - Customers with low annual income and low annual spend</li>
<li>Cluster 4(turquoise) - Customers with high annual income but low annual spend</li>
<li>Cluster 5(pink) - Customers low annual income but high annual spend</li>
