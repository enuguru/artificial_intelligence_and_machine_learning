# KNN

The dataset was created for prediction of Graduate Admissions
https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions/home

The code loops through some Knn predictions and charts the results to find an
optimal K Value using the "elbow method".

I will predict the chances for acceptance using the following parameters.

1. GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
2. TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
3. University Rating ( out of 5 )
4. Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
5. Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
6. Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )

The output class to predict:
Chance of Admission (0 = False, 1 = True)

So far the best that I can do is:
weighted avg       0.92      0.92      0.92
